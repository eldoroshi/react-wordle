      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      <h2>What is Wordle?</h2>
      <p>Wordle is a web-based word game created and developed by Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle, and owned and published by The New York Times Company since 2022.</p>

<p>The game is played by creating words out of a grid of random letters. The longer the word, the more points the player scores. The game keeps track of the player's score, and the player can compete against other players by sharing their score on social media.
      </p>
<p>Wordle was originally created as a way to generate word clouds, but has since been developed into a full game. The game is free to play, and does not require registration.</p>
